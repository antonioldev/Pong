## Pong
For the Pong project, I recreated the classic arcade game where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

**Key Points**:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: I delved deeper into OOP concepts, creating and managing game objects such as paddles and the ball.
- **Complex User Input**: I learned to handle more complex user inputs, including simultaneous inputs from multiple players.
- **Game Physics**: I implemented game physics for realistic ball movement and collision detection between the ball and paddles.
- **Game States**: I explored the concept of game states, such as starting, playing, and game over states, and how to manage transitions between them.

## SFML Library
Throughout these projects, I used the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), which is a cross-platform library designed to provide a simple interface to various multimedia components in C++. SFML is particularly useful for game development due to its simplicity and ease of use.

**Key Features**:
- **Graphics**: Rendering shapes, sprites, and text. SFML makes it easy to draw 2D graphics and handle basic animations.
- **Windowing**: Creating and managing game windows. SFML provides a straightforward way to create windows and handle events such as resizing and closing.
- **Audio**: Playing sound effects and music. SFML supports various audio formats and allows for easy playback and control of sounds.
- **Input**: Handling keyboard, mouse, and joystick input. SFML simplifies the process of capturing and responding to user inputs.
